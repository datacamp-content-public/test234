  The basics of modern R will get you far, but sometimes you face complex data
  and tasks. Programming in tidyverse will help you exactly then -- it will
  teach you how to do it all with the elegance you have gotten used to with
  tidyverse. You will be able to convert your tidyverse code into reusable
  functions, you will add some powerful concepts into your toolset. All this
  while taking a peek on how are some general skills (like literacy and
  numeracy) connected with labor market outcomes (like income or unemployment)
  in the US.
